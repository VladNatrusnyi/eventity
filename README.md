# eventity
Eventity is a platform for organizing holidays and events. The main goal and idea of ​​my project is that everyone who wants to organize a fun holiday (birthdays, weddings, corporate events, festivals, etc.) and they need a toastmaster, musicians, decorators, animators, chefs, restaurants or others performers will no longer have to search for themselves, but can place ads on the site about their holiday, specifying detailed information about it (such as venue, date, required staff, personal wishes), and any artist in search of work will be able to respond to your event. Then you, among all the performers who responded, choose the one that suits you and cooperate. The site gives you the opportunity to be both an organizer of the holiday and a performer. Therefore, once you register, you can organize your holiday and respond to someone else as a performer of a particular job.
